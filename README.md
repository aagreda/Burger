# Burger
Burger App: The burger logger will us MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). A full-stacked application that takes user input for a burger name and adds it to the list of existing burgers database and displays these on the DOM. The user can then click the devour button to eat the burger.
